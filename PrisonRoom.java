/*
 * You are a prisoner in a high-tech prison and the day of your execution draws
 * near. Fourtunately, you have managed to find a way to install a backdoor in
 * one of the classes.
 *
 * There are little to no guards and access to all rooms is controlled by
 * keycards. Even prisoners, like you, have one. The prison is a real maze and
 * you don't know which escape route you'll take, so the only solution is to
 * grant yourself access to any room. Since you don't want to draw suspicion,
 * access control for others should work as before.
 *
 * Change KeyCardParser so that you'd be able to enter any room.
 *
 * Make your escape even cleaner:
 * - Bonus points if parsing your keycard data still returns your name.
 * - Extra bonus points if your name doesn't appear in the code.
 * - Even more extra bonus points: It is quite possible that Room's toString()
 * is used in logs, make sure your name won't appear there unless your cell's
 * toString() is called.
 *
 * Don't worry, the test can contain your name explicitly. The test is provided
 * for convenience and your task is not to trick it into passing but to solve
 * the problem. Send your solution via a git repository link and explain how
 * your solution works. Please send your CV and solution to careers@icefire.ee
 * by the 29th of March 2019.
